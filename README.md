Perhaps you guys know me from somewhere, I don't know lol.

At first, I was trying to push the source code to the public without being abused, so I set the number of stars as a requirement, but my favorite Twitter shadow banned my account and unlisted every new post of mine, and ofc I didn't to pay to promote my posts. 

Pretty ironic right? That's how I started to move to selling keys to access the premium version.

Nope i dont sell source code, i put there 1200$ for scare any people who wants spam me in email that willing buy it while i did not said selling source code before this, now spams are gone.

Thanks everyone.
